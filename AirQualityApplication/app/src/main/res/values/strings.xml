    <string name="brandon_bio">Brandon Agostinelli is currently a junior computer science major at
        Oswego State.\n\nHis interest in computers began after his freshmen year at Oswego State.
        And since then, being the motivated learner that his is, his goal from the start has been
        to learn how machines and systems work both inside software and hardware.\n\nBrandon joined
        the development team for this application in late August 2014. He graduated from Penfield
        High School in Rochester New York in 2012.\n\nHome is of the upmost importance to him in more
        ways than one. Brandon is set to graduate in the spring of 2016. His favorite all time
        thing is Baseball, just as him. Brandon spends loads of his time when not working on
        projects and other assignments on enjoying the outdoors and playing sports with friends
        and family. He can be contacted at bagostin (at) oswego (dot) edu.</string>
